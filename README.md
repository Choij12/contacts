# React Native
- Create your first native phone/device application using React Native, tapping into at least 2 phone features.

***Milestone 1***
- Deliver your MVP for raw functionality
- Your dev environment should be properly working
- Other users should be able to scan your QR and see your app on any device
- All of your core “features” should be working properly
- Un-Styled is fine. We’re looking for things to buzz, light up, detect movement, etc.

***Milestone 2 - Product Delivery***
- As you complete your RNA, switch your focus to the user experience.

- Quality and Thoughtful Styling using css-in-js
- Right sized tap targets, good contrast
- Dark and Light Modes
- Well thought through UX
- Be considerate of individuals that primarily use their thumbs, left or right hands
